**Natural units in Python**

.. warning:: This project is currently in a pre-release state.  It will be
   officially released once the unit tests are complete.

natu_ is a free, open-source package to represent physical quantities.  There
are `many Python packages that deal with units and quantities
<http://kdavies4.github.io/natu/seealso.html>`_, but natu_ is uniquely
system-independent.  The units are derived from physical constants with
adjustable values and dimensions.  The value of a unit is factored into a
quantity so that the quantity is not "in" any particular unit.  This has the
following advantages:

- **Flexibility**: Different unit systems, including `natural units`_ (hence the
  name "natu"), can be represented by simply adjusting the physical constants.
- **Simplicity**: Unit conversion is inherent.  This results in quick
  computations and a small code base.  By default, dimensions and display units
  are tracked to catch errors and for string formatting, respectively.  However,
  this can be turned off to reduce the computational overhead to nearly zero
  while still providing the core features.
- **Scalability**: The values of the base physical constants can scaled to
  prevent exponent overflow, regardless of the units used.
- **Intuitive**: Each unit is a fixed quantity which can be treated as a
  mathematical entity.  A variable quantity is expressed as the product of a
  number and a unit, as stated by BIPM_.
- **Representative**: The structure of the package reflects the way modern units
  are defined: standards organizations such as NIST_ assign values to universal
  physical constants so that the values of units can be determined by physical
  experiments instead of prototypes.

For example, you can do this:

    >>> from natu.units import degC, K
    >>> print(0*degC + 100*K)
    100.0 degC
